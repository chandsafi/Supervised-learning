# Supervised Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of key supervised learning algorithms used in predictive modeling. Each algorithm is applied to solve a regression or classification problem, with code files available for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Contents

1. **[Linear Regression](Linear-regression.ipynb)**  
   - **Purpose:** Predict continuous numerical outcomes based on input features.
   - **Use Case:** Predicting values such as house prices, salaries, etc.
   - **Key Concepts:** 
     - Assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output.
     - Includes steps such as fitting the model, calculating the coefficients, and evaluating performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

2. **[Logistic Regression](Logistic-regression.ipynb)**  
   - **Purpose:** Classify categorical outcomes, typically binary (e.g., 0 or 1).
   - **Use Case:** Predicting binary outcomes such as email spam detection or loan approval.
   - **Key Concepts:** 
     - Uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to map predicted values to probabilities.
     - Includes steps such as model fitting, threshold determination, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. **[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](KNN.ipynb)**  
   - **Purpose:** Predict outcomes by finding the majority class (classification) or the average (regression) of the k-nearest data points in the feature space.
   - **Use Case:** Classifying data like customer segmentation or predicting product ratings.
   - **Key Concepts:** 
     - Relies on distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) to find the closest points.
     - Includes hyperparameter tuning to select the best value of "k" and evaluates performance using confusion matrix or other relevant metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kainattkhan/Supervised-Learning-Algorithms.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) in your environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Google Colab).
3. Run the cells to see how each algorithm is implemented and applied to datasets.
